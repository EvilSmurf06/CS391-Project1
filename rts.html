        StarCraft is a 1998 military science fiction real-time strategy game developed and published by Blizzard Entertainment for Microsoft Windows.
        The game spawned the StarCraft franchise, and became the first game of the video game series.
        A Classic Mac OS version was released in 1999, and a Nintendo 64 adaptation, co-developed with Mass Media, was released in 2000.
        <br>
      <p>
        Blizzard started work on the game shortly after Warcraft II, another real-time strategy game, was released in 1995.
        The first incarnation debuted at the 1996 Electronic Entertainment Expo, where it was unfavorably compared to Warcraft II.
        As a result, the project was entirely overhauled before being showcased to the public in early 1997, at which time it received a far more positive response.
        The game's multiplayer is particularly popular in South Korea, as of 2006, where players and teams participate in professional competitions, earn sponsorships, and compete in televised tournaments.

        Age of Mythology (AoM) is a real-time strategy video game developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft Game Studios.
        It was released on October 30, 2002 in North America and a week later in Europe.
        A spin-off from the Age of Empires series, Age of Mythology takes some of its inspiration from mythology and legends of the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse, rather than from actual historical events.
        Many gameplay elements are similar to the Age of Empires series.
        Its campaign follows an Atlantean admiral, Arkantos, who is forced to travel through the lands of the game's three cultures, hunting for a cyclops who is in league with Poseidon against Atlantis.

      <p>
        Age of Mythology was commercially successful, going platinum four months after its release after selling over one million units.
        In 2003, it was followed by an expansion pack, Age of Mythology: The Titans. On May 8, 2014, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition was released for Windows via Steam.
        This was followed by a second expansion pack, Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon, released on January 28, 2016.
