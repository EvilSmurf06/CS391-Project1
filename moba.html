                    League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
                    Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.
                    Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization.
                    The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map.
                    Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play.
                     During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team.
                    In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.

                    Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve.
                    The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos.
                    Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map.
                    Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero", who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play.

                    During a match players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat.
                    A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located within their base.
                    Development of Dota 2 began in 2009 when IceFrog, lead designer of Defense of the Ancients, was hired by Valve to create a modernized remake for them in the Source game engine.
                    It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux via the digital distribution platform Steam in July 2013, following a Windows-only open beta phase that began two years prior.

                    The game features various characters from Blizzard's franchises as playable heroes, as well as different battlegrounds based on Warcraft, Diablo, StarCraft, and Overwatch universes.
                    The game is free-to-play, based on freemium business model, and is supported by microtransactions which can be used to purchase heroes, visual alterations for the heroes in the game, mounts, and other cosmetic elements.
